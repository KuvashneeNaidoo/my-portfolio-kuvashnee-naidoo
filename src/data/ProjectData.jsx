      "This project required me to build a fully responsive Connect Four game, where users can drop colored discs into columns and see them stack in real-time. I used React.js for the game logic and interactivity, with Tailwind CSS for styling and responsive layout.",

      "The game offers two modes: player vs player and player vs CPU (Central Processing Unit), each providing an engaging challenge. It includes a responsive layout, interactive elements such as a game timer, score tracking, and animated transitions for moves. The goal was to create an engaging user experience with real-time updates and ensure compatibility across various screen sizes. This project helped me improve my skills in React state management, event handling, and responsive design, allowing me to create an interactive front-end application.",

I leaned on layout tools like Flexbox and Grid to build sections like testimonials, feature highlights, and the call-to-action. Taking a mobile-first approach pushed me to think more intentionally about scaling content, and this project really improved my understanding of semantic HTML and how to create a clear visual hierarchy that works across devices.",
